# **Customer Churn Analysis**: *Unveiling the recipe for customer departure*
## Project Scenario
Every company wants to increase its profit or revenue margin and customer retention is one key area industry players focus their resources. In today's world of machine learning, most companies build classification models to perform churn analysis on their customers. 

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model for binary classification. The model will predict whether a given instance belongs to one of two classes based on a set of input features.

### Background
Vodafone, a telecommunication company want to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be applied to avert this problem.

### Project Ojectives
- Develop and train a machine learning model using historical data to predict whether a customer will churn or not.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics : accuracy,precision,recall,f1-score.
- Fine-tune the model parameters with GridSearchCv to optimize performance.
- Perform hypothesis testing to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis


### Data for the project
The data for this projects has been divided into 3. The first 2 data sets are for training and evaluation the machine learning model  while the last data set is for testing the model.

### Business Sucess Criteria
- Model accuracy: The model's accuracy should be above 70%
- Retention Strategy Effectiveness: The implemented retention strategies should show a measurable impact on reducing customer churn rates. This can be assessed by comparing churn rates before and after implementing the strategies.
- Cost Reduction: The model should contribute to reducing the costs associated with customer acquisition by identifying at-risk customers early on and allowing targeted retention efforts.
- Customer Satisfaction: While focusing on retention, the model and strategies should also aim to maintain or improve customer satisfaction levels. High customer satisfaction leads to increased loyalty and potentially higher customer lifetime value.
- Adaptability and Scalability: The developed model should be adaptable to changing business environments and scalable to accommodate larger datasets or additional features. This ensures its long-term viability and usefulness for the company.
- Feedback and Iteration: Continuous feedback loops should be established to gather insights from the model's predictions and refine the retention strategies accordingly. This iterative process ensures ongoing improvement and optimization of the churn prediction system.

### Future Work
Deploy the model to be used in the company's mobile/web application

## üîÖHypothesis

Initial exploration on the data gave insight to a **null hypothesis** and its **alternative hypothesis** stated below:
- **Null Hypothesis (Ho)**: There is no significant relationship between the amount of monthly customer charges and customer churn.

- **Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)**: There is a statistically significant relationship between the amount of monthly customer charges and customer churn.
For the hypothesis testing, the method choice was Wilcoxon rank-sum test for reasons of unevenly distributed data.

## ‚úçÔ∏èData Understanding
The data was pulled from the following various sources:
- data from a Github repository
- data from a OneDrive 
- data from a remote database

Data from the Github repository and SQL database data sets were used in this project for training and evaluation the machine
learning model while the last data set was used for testing the accuracy of the model.

The major libraries used for this project were:
 1. Data manipulation: NumPy, pandas
 2. Data visualisation : Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
 3. Machine learning methods : Sklearn, imblearn

 
From a quick screening of EDA, training and evaluation datasets had common column names as stated in the data dictionary
 These were therefore concatenated and the dataframe was later investigated in the exploratory data analysis for data cleaning.
## üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èData cleaning

The first phase of the cleaning aspect checked for duplicates, nulls, mismatched columns, data coherency, datatypes and column names

There were some observations which included:

- null values present in the following columns: Multiple Lines, Online Security, Online Backup, Device Protection  ,Tech Support ,Streaming TV , Streaming Movies, Total Charges and Churn
- the datatype of total charges column assuming an object status instead of a numerical data type
- there are no duplicates in the concatenated stage
- some column value meant the same thing had synonymous names. eg. true and yes, no and false etc.
- all charge amounts are in the currency $
 


Overall, the dataset did not need much cleaning. Key highlights of the cleaning involved:

- Converting to right datatypes
- Renaming column names to be coherent with each dataset
- Mapping boolean and None values to more meaningful categories
- Filling null values


As this project included building machine models to predict, some filling of null values were paused in this stage and incorporated in the machine learning pipelines to improve the robustness of the model






## üîÖExploratory Data Analysis
The Exploratory Data Analysis phase delved deep into the cleaned and preprocessed datasets of the Customer Churn Analysis. Through a series of analytical techniques and visualizations, key insights were uncovered, shedding light on various aspects of what prompts churn. The following are some of the key insights gained from the EDA process:

Following a descriptive summary, these were some results observed:

***SeniorCitizen*** : a mean value of 0.162 suggesting that approximately 16.24% of the customers in the dataset are senior citizens.The standard deviation of 0.369 indicates some variability in the distribution of senior citizen status among customers and the minimum value of 0 implies that there are non-senior customers in the dataset.

***Tenure*** : On average, customers stay with the service provider for approximately 32.58 months.The minimum tenure is 0 months, which could indicate newly acquired customers and the maximum tenure is 72 months, indicating some customers have been with the provider for a significant period.The standard deviation of 24.53 suggests that there is a considerable variation in tenure lengths among customers.

***MonthlyCharges*** : The minimum monthly charge is $18.40, while the maximum is $118.65 and on average, customers are charged approximately $65.09 per month.The standard deviation of 30.07 indicates variability in monthly charges among customers.

***TotalCharges*** : On average, customers have been charged a total of approximately $2302.06 while The minimum total charge is $18.80, while the maximum is $8670.10. The standard deviation of $2269.48 suggests significant variability in total charges among customers.

Following **univariate and bivariate analysis**, it revealed:
- high positive skewness of the dataset
- an imbalanced dataset
- little/no outliers
- high range of values in the numerical columns prompting scaling



## üìâData Analysis 
Visualisations were produced based on the analytical questions asked. These visuals were paramount to providing a solid foundation for analysising any trends or hitting patterns in analysing the factors contributing to churn analysis

 Business Questions
1. How do different levels of monthly customer charges impact churn rates?
2. Do customers who pay more monthly charges tend to stay longer? 
3. Is there a correlation between higher monthly charges and improved service quality (e.g., better internet speed, enhanced customer support)?
4. Are customers on longer-term contracts (e.g., annual contracts) less likely to churn compared to those on month-to-month plans?
5. How does the relationship between monthly charges and churn differ based on contract duration? Can we encourage customers to opt for longer contracts to reduce churn?
6. Does the amount of time spent being a customer have a relationship with the probability of churning by gender?
7. Does one's total charges over the year increase as expected or is there a trend of discount for loyal customers?
8. Which Internet Service Provider accounts for the most charges?
9. What is the effect of method of payment on customer churn?


Although executed separately in jupyter notebook, these visualisations were deployed in PowerBI and the results are as shown in the dashboard below.

## üîéData preparation and preprocessing

The target column was the **Churn** column

‚≠ïThe Churn column was visualised to check the degree of imbalance as this could impact the accuracy of the machine learning models. It was moderately imbalanced with a ratio of 70:30

‚≠ïA Phi-K matrix was used to compare the correlation between the churn and all other features especially the categorical features.
From the Phi-K matrix, the features most important for data modeling were:

- Tenure

- Payment method

- Monthly charges

- Paperless billing

- Dependents

- Contracts

- Total Charges



The features were then further investigated for multicollinearity. The following were flagged:

- Tenure and total charges with a correlation coefficient of 0.84
- Total charges and monthly charges with a correlation coefficient of 0.76


Further actions were to exclude totalcharges and drop the other columns not identified significant for modeling

‚≠ïData was split into train and test groups 80/20 respectively

‚≠ïSeveral pipelines were created to impute missing values, scale numerical values and encode categorical columns


## üìêModeling

The dataset is moderately imbalanced. The modelling was done in two phases,
- first using methods known to be able to handle imbalanced datasets to train
- upscaling and then train on balanced data using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)

Six models were used in training the data namely:
- Decision Tree Classifier 
- K Neighbors Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- CatBoost Classifier
- Logistic Regression

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models were:
- accuracy 
- precision
- recall 
- f1_score
- confusion matrix

  Important to note: Accuracy was not deemed reliable in evaluating modeling with imbalanced data.

## ‚öΩModel Evaluation and Prediction
- The top 3 performing models from the best modeling strategy (with balanced or imbalanced data) underwent hyperparameter tuning using Random Search Object grid.
   - The results from this search was incorporated in fine tuning the models and making predictions.
- The model was visually evaluuated using the AUC (Area Under The Curve) ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve

- A test dataset was preprocessed in the same manner as the train data and the best estimator was used to predict the churn column.

- The machine learning models were saved for future use deployment.


## üëÄObservations
***From EDA and visualisations***:


üóùÔ∏è***Monthly charges*** : Monthly charges play a significant role in customer churning. However, prices may differ because some customers include some additional services. There seems to be a range of high charges where the probability of churning is high.

üóùÔ∏è***Services***: Most customers choose to have an internet services with some added services. There is a slight increase of monthly charges for those who include services than those who don't but when linked to churn, it is a 50-50 chance.

üóùÔ∏è***Contract*** : In general customers prefer month-to-month contracts compared to other types such as two year or one year contracts. This can be interpreted as many customers desiring flexibility to change their decision as at when as most year contracts have terms and conditions.
- Customers who opt for one or two years typcaly have charges ranging from as low as $20- 110 per month.
- Customers having a contact of one year who fall in the range of $70-$100 have a high chance of churning.
- Customers having a contact of two years who fall in the range of $100- $110 have a high chance of churning although the outliers in the chart suggest some ccustomers churning even at low monthly charges.

üóùÔ∏è***Tenure*** : Customers who have stay onger have the lowest risk of churning.

üóùÔ∏è**Hypothesis testing**:

With a P-value of **1.2019873209608733e-42**, the null hypothesis was rejected and it was maintained that there is indeed statistically significant relationship between the amount of monthly customer charges and customer churn.



***From modeling***:


üóùÔ∏èFrom training with unbalanced data, the top 3 performing models based on the f1_score are: logistic regression, catboost and sgb_classifier. Confusion matrix metric revealed the machine still classifying churn incorrectly

üóùÔ∏èFrom training with balanced data, the top 3 performing models based on the f1_score are: catboost, sgb_classifier and random_forest. Confusion matrix metric revealed the machine still classifying churn incorrectly although the True Positives had increased.

üóùÔ∏èVisualization of the performance of the binary classification problem using the AUC (Area Under The Curve) ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve showed a good performance of the models with AUC-values above 70% (with the exception of the decision tree model) which shows a good sign to be in production.
The best threshold for True Positive Rate (TPR) as compared to False Positive Rate (FPR) is 0.1760 with a FPR of 0.493261 and TPR of 0.966292.

üóùÔ∏èFine tuning the top 3 models with hyperparameters emerged sgb classifier as the best estimator with an f-1 score of 0.78

















## ‚úçÔ∏èConclusion and Recommendations
- From the study, it can be concluded that Monthly charges is the heart of customer churning in Vodafone. The company has approximately 73% of customers retained. However, 27% of customers churning is somewhat of significant value and should be addressed.

- There was no siginificant correlation between gender and churn, therefore remedial strategies should apply to all irrespective of gender.
 - Most customers are not senior citizens, therefore more focus should be centered on the youth.

- In addition, although many customers use electronic check, it is this same group that churns the most. A mobile payment method could be tested and implemented to investigate if electronic check is a hassle for customers. 

- It is also recommended that regardless of the additional services offered, there should be a cap on monthly charges and the risk of churning increases after a range.

- It is also recommended to include attractive benefits, discounts for loyal customers over time to encourage customers to choose year contracts. The charges for year contracts could also be lowered to seem like a more attractive than month-to-month

Overall, Vodafone could take advantage of the key features leading to churn and implemented the recommendations when a customer is predicted to churn
